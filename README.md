  <h3>Why this repo exists</h3>
</div>

I created this repository as a **public portfolio of my problem-solving journey** on LeetCode.

It contains:

- Clean, well-commented Python solutions  
- Explanations of thought process & time/space complexity  
- Organized by problem code of leetcode  
- Regularly updated with new problems, contest performances, and pattern learnings

Whether you're a recruiter looking for evidence of consistent practice, another developer wanting reference solutions, or just someone curious about how I approach problems — feel free to explore!
